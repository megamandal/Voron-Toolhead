I have created this toolhead mount for myself, 
as I prefer to use a 4010 hotend cooling fan, 
but looking to reduce the weight after upgrading to Rapido+ 2 UHF from a dragon, 
the extra size of the stealthburner had reduced the result on input shaper,
also I am lack on cooling for higher speed printing, 
CPAP is on the card but for now I play with this one.
after posting on voron group on facebook, there seems to be many interested, 
so I put it here for you guys to try out,
feel free to make any improvement if you want to.

Print settings same as voron with minimal supports. heat inserts required
